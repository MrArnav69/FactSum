Republicans currently hold 29 governorships, Democrats 20, and Rhode Island's Lincoln Chafee is an Independent, the New York Times reports. But the GOP is expected to pick up at least one governorship, that of North Carolina's Pat McCrory, who is in a tight race with Democratic incumbent Beverly Perdue. Republicans are also expected to win in Utah, North Dakota, and Indiana, and to hold on to seats in West Virginia, Missouri, and Vermont. The only races considered competitive are in Montana, New","– It's a race for the governor's mansion in 11 states today, and the GOP could end the night at the helm of more than two-thirds of the 50 states. The GOP currently controls 29 of the country's top state offices; it's expected to keep the three Republican ones that are up for grabs (Utah, North Dakota, and Indiana), and wrest North Carolina from the Dems. That brings its toll to 30, with the potential to take three more, reports NPR. Races in Montana, New Hampshire, and Washington are still too close to call, and in all three, Democrat incumbents aren't seeking reelection. The results could have a big impact on health care, since a Supreme Court ruling grants states the ability to opt out of ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion. ""A Romney victory would dramatically empower Republican governors,"" said one analyst. Click for NPR's state-by-state breakdown of what could happen."

The photo was posted on a Facebook page called Dangerous Minds to promote a “gay kiss-in” demonstration in London to protest the pub. The page was quickly removed and an email was sent to administrators of the Facebook page: “ Shares that contain nudity, or any kind of graphic or sexually suggestive content, are not permitted on Facebook.” The photo has prompted scores of people, many of whom published their own pictures of the couples.","– It turns out Facebook is only guilty of about half of what it’s been accused of in the gay kiss incident. The social networking site apologized yesterday for taking down an image used to promote a “kiss-in” event in London. “The photo in question does not violate our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities, and was removed in error,” the site said in a statement, according to the Advocate. But Facebook did not, as has been reported in several places, take down the kiss-in event itself. Here’s what happened: The photo Facebook took down was posted by the Dangerous Minds blog to promote the event. In its initial write-up about the incident, the blog observed that the page organizing the protest had been taken down. But it was actually the organizer himself who ""removed"" the event, Dangerous Minds clarified. Organizer Paul Shetler explains that he decided to switch it from a public event to a private one, as ""there were starting to be trolls posting abusive nonsense on it."""

The county's board of supervisors voted 4-1 this week to explore secession from California, with the lone ""no"" vote coming from the chair of the board, reports the Redding Record Searchlight. Proponents of the move say they want to form a new state called Jefferson with other counties in the area and Southern Oregon. ""We need our own state so we can make laws that fit our way of life,"" says one resident. ""The state of Jefferson is the place I want to raise my son.""","– Not a big fan of Southern California? Neither is Northern California, apparently. Supervisors in rural Siskiyou County voted 4-1 Tuesday in favor of seceding from the state, reports the Times-Standard. The county thinks state officials in Sacramento are too focused on the big metro areas of the south and thus want to form a state of its own—to be called Jefferson. Supporters want to invite other northern counties, and perhaps a few from Oregon, to join, too, notes the Los Angeles Times. ”We have to have government that's local, understands our issues, and has empathy,” says one local rancher. It's clearly a very long-shot bid, one that would eventually require the blessing of both the state legislature and the US Congress. Still, neighboring Humboldt County is expected to meet soon to consider the idea. (Meanwhile, some counties in Colorado want to form a new state of their own.)"
