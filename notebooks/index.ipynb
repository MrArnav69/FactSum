      "SUMMARY:\n",
      " – It's a race for the governor's mansion in 11 states today, and the GOP could end the night at the helm of more than two-thirds of the 50 states. The GOP currently controls 29 of the country's top state offices; it's expected to keep the three Republican ones that are up for grabs (Utah, North Dakota, and Indiana), and wrest North Carolina from the Dems. That brings its toll to 30, with the potential to take three more, reports NPR. Races in Montana, New Hampshire, and Washington are still too close to call, and in all three, Democrat incumbents aren't seeking reelection. The results could have a big impact on health care, since a Supreme Court ruling grants states the ability to opt out of ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion. \"A Romney victory would dramatically empower Republican governors,\" said one analyst.

The GOP currently controls 29 of the country's top state offices; it's expected to keep the three Republican ones that are up for grabs (Utah, North Dakota, and Indiana), and wrest North Carolina from the Dems. That brings its toll to 30, with the potential to take three more, reports NPR. Races in Montana, New Hampshire, and Washington are still too close to call, and in all three, Democrat incumbents aren't seeking reelection. The results could have a big impact on health care, since a Supreme Court ruling grants states the ability to opt out of ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion. \"A Romney victory would dramatically empower Republican governors,\" said one analyst.

      "– It's a big night for Republicans, who are expected to easily take control of more than a third of the nation's governors' seats. Republicans currently hold 29 governorships, Democrats 20; and Rhode Island's Lincoln Chafee is an Independent, the Los Angeles Times reports. Eight of the seats up for grabs are now held by Democrats; three are in Republican hands. Polls and race analysts suggest that only three of tonight's races are considered competitive, all in states where incumbent Democratic governors aren't running again: Montana, New Hampshire, and Washington. While those state races remain too close to call, Republicans are likely to wrest the North Carolina governorship from Democratic control, and to easily win GOP-held seats in Utah, North Dakota, and Indiana. Democrats are likely hold on to their seats in West Virginia and Missouri; and expected to notch safe wins in races they hold in Vermont and Delaware.

      "– It's a race for the governor's mansion in 11 states today, and the GOP could end the night at the helm of more than two-thirds of the 50 states. The GOP currently controls 29 of the country's top state offices; it's expected to keep the three Republican ones that are up for grabs (Utah, North Dakota, and Indiana), and wrest North Carolina from the Dems. That brings its toll to 30, with the potential to take three more, reports NPR. Races in Montana, New Hampshire, and Washington are still too close to call, and in all three, Democrat incumbents aren't seeking reelection. The results could have a big impact on health care, since a Supreme Court ruling grants states the ability to opt out of ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion. \"A Romney victory would dramatically empower Republican governors,\" said one analyst.
