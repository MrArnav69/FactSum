"– Scientists are calling it a breakthrough and a turning point: In a new study, a compound successfully halted brain cell death in mice, meaning we're one step closer to a pill that can treat Alzheimer's, the Independent reports.

The compound blocks the faulty brain signal that causes the initial ""shutdown,"" thus basically flipping the switch from ""off"" back to ""on."" Proteins are produced, brain cells are protected, and symptoms are reversed. The mice in the study had prion disease, which is similar to a human neurodegenerative disorder. After receiving the compound, memory loss and other symptoms including impaired reflexes and limb dragging were reversed; the treated mice also lived longer than those who didn't receive the compound, Sky News reports.

The world produced around 54 million tons of electronic waste in total last year, researchers found, and though it can be valuable—a million old cell phones can yield 53 pounds of gold and 550 pounds of silver, Reuters notes—recycling rates remain low and where e-waste is recycled, it is often done so in a way harmful to both the environment and workers' health. The rate of waste is so high because engineers are constantly creating innovative designs to lure people to buy more, an earth sciences professor tells the Toronto Star. ""Why won’t these same smart people also find a way that electronics can be used longer or reused in the best way, too?”","– By 2017, the volume of discarded refrigerators, TVs, computers, monitors, and other electronic waste will be as much as 200 Empire State Buildings, according to a new UN report. Last year, the world produced about 54 million tons of used electronics. That's an average of 43 pounds, or the weight of eight bricks for each of the 7 billion people on Earth. But by 2017, the world is expected to produce about 33% more e-waste, or 65 million tons. That amount weighs about 11 times as many as the Great Pyramid of Giza. China currently leads the world in production of electrical and electronic equipment. In 2012, China produced about 12.2 million tons, while the US produced about 11 million tons—though more products are likely to be retired in the US.

A big percentage: The Washington Post picks out five times Kennedy cast the deciding vote on big issues, on everything from backing abortion rights to supporting gay rights to curtailing the death penalty. The story notes that of the 276 majority opinions written by Kennedy, 92 came in 5-4 decisions.","– Anthony Kennedy's announcement that he'll retire from the Supreme Court at the end of the month has set the stage for what is expected to be a contentious confirmation process.

"– She met four teen girls through social media and acquaintances and quickly tried to befriend them. But it wasn't their friendship Jelinajane Bedrijo Almario was after, say police in Hanford, Calif. Over the next few weeks in 2016, Almario, then just 16, pimped the girls, aged 14 and 15, by posting their photos on prostitution websites and driving them to meet clients at motels in Tulare County, Detective Richard Pontecorvo tells the Fresno Bee. Thankfully, ""we caught her case very early,"" he adds. Almario was arrested in May 2016 and charged as an adult with human trafficking and making terrorist threats. On Monday, two days after her 18th birthday, she was sentenced to 13 years in prison. ""It was a huge eye-opener for us,"" Pontecorvo says of the case, heard in Kings County Superior Court. ""We were able to get these girls back home and get them the help they needed … but these pimps are ruining these kids' lives at an early age."" Pimps like Almario, he adds, per UPI, ""are great at locating kids with low self-esteem and trying to be their friend, and then it obviously changes."" For example, Almario once sent threatening emails to the mother of one of her victims who was simply looking for her daughter, reports the AP. Pontecorvo explains the girls Almario targeted ""would run away for weekends or work a couple of nights.""
