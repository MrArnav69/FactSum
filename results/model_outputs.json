{"pegasus": ["\u2013 Republicans are expected to keep control of more than two-thirds of the nation's governor's offices tonight. Republicans currently hold 29 governorships, Democrats have 20, and Rhode Island's Lincoln Chafee is an Independent, NPR reports. In fact, Republicans are on track to increase their numbers by at least one, with the potential to extend their hold to more than two-thirds of the nation's top state offices. Eight of the gubernatorial seats up for grabs are now held by Democrats; three are in Republican hands. Polls and race analysts suggest that only three of tonight's races are considered competitive, all in states where incumbent Democratic governors aren't running again: Montana, New Hampshire, and Washington. While those state races remain too close to call, Republicans are expected to wrest the North Carolina governorship from Democratic control, and to easily win GOP-held seats in Utah, North Dakota, and Indiana. Democrats are likely to hold on to their seats in West Virginia and Missouri, and are expected to notch safe wins in races for seats they hold in Vermont and Delaware.

The county board of supervisors voted 4-1 on Tuesday to pursue secession from California, the Redding Record Searchlight reports. More than 100 people attended the meeting, many of them in support of the move, which would create a new state called Jefferson. \"Many proposed laws are unconstitutional and deny us our God-given rights,\" said one resident. \"We need our own state so we can make laws that fit our way of life.\" Siskiyou would join neighboring counties in Northern California and Southern Oregon in the new state. \"I was one of the people who thinks the state of Jefferson wasn't a bad idea,\" said a Humboldt County supervisor. \"There has been a total lack of respect of our water rights and the fire fee.

Here's what you need to know about the deal, which comes just days after Steve Ballmer stepped down as Microsoft CEO: The move is a smart one for Microsoft, writes Rolfe Winkler in the Wall Street Journal. The company is now \"poised to adopt a vertically integrated strategy more akin to Apple's,\" he writes, but the real test will come when the two companies work together to create a more complete mobile experience for customers. The deal is a good one for Microsoft, writes Henry Blodget at Business Insider, but he warns that it's also a bad one for Nokia. The company has lost its lead in the smartphone market to both Apple and Google, and the deal will make it more difficult for Nokia to compete. Microsoft has been working on a devices and services strategy for a while now, and the Nokia deal is the latest step in that direction, writes Dan Nosowitz at ZDNet. \"Own the desktop (via Windows) and building additional services on top, like Office or search, has been vital for Microsoft's strategy until now, so as our interest shifts from the desktop to the tablet or smartphone", "\u2013 The Supreme Court kicks off its new term today, and there are a lot of high-profile cases on the docket. Here's a look at some of the ones that could come to the court's attention: Abortion: The court could rule as soon as next month on whether states can regulate abortion clinics, the New York Times reports. A lower court had already struck down a key part of California's law, but the high court could order a new round of appeals. Abortion: The court could rule as soon as next month on a challenge to President Obama's executive order on immigration, Politico reports. A lower court had already blocked the president's plan, but it's unclear whether that will hold up this term or if Obama's plan will be put on hold until after the president leaves office.  affirmative action: The court could rule on the constitutionality of Texas' affirmative action program, which uses race as a factor in college admissions.

Jamaluddin Aberoumand, deputy coordinator for Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, said the incident indicated that Israel's Iron Dome \"does not work and lacks the necessary capacity\" to deal with missiles. \"The Zionist regime (Israel) has many enemies,\" he added. The Israeli air force released a 10-second video clip of what it said was Saturday's mid-air interception, showing a small aircraft just before a missile from a fighter jet destroys it. The drone was first spotted above the Mediterranean near the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip to the west of Israel, said military spokeswoman Avital Leibovich. An Israeli parliament member wrote on Twitter it was an \"Iranian drone launched by Hezbollah,\" referring to the Lebanese Shi'ite group that fought a war with Israel in 2006. Israeli defense officials have not confirmed or deny them. The Iron Dome system, jointly funded with the US, is designed to shoot down short-range guerrilla rockets, not slow-flying aircraft.

According to NBC News, the painting had been bequeathed to France's National Museum by a former director, but museum staff discovered it was missing in 2001 when they received a loan request for it. It was valued at more than $2.5 million at the time, the AP reports. The sender of the December shipment was identified only as \"Robert,\" who mailed the painting to a climate-controlled storage facility in Queens. The painting was seized by the Department of Homeland Security, and Lynch filed a civil complaint to return it to France. \"The market to sell stolen antiquities in the United States is drying up,\" a Homeland Security Investigations agent said in a statement.

Each call involved the same male voice and used an emergency radio channel. He's been making the calls since July 2014. The two most recent calls were made on the night of July 21 and the early morning of July 22. The Coast Guard also says hoax calls distract rescuers from real emergencies, putting both the public and the responding crews at risk. \"A hoax call is a deadly and serious offense,\" says Lt. Cmdr. Sara Wallace. \"Calls like these not only put our crews at risk, but they put the lives of the public at risk.\" Making false distress calls is a felony, punishable by up to six years in prison, a $10,000 civil fine, $250,000 criminal fine, and a reimbursement to the Coast Guard for their efforts, the Coast Guard says.", "\u2013 The Obama campaign sent out a mailer in Ohio that looks a lot like an online cat meme\u2014but it's not actually about cats.

But the New York Times takes a closer look at those talking points, and finds that they were heavily edited. For one thing, they didn't include any mention of al-Qaeda. For another, they didn't include any details of the attack on the US consulate in Libya, which is what killed Ambassador Chris Stevens. And they didn't include any details of the attack on the US ambassador to Libya, which is what killed him. And they didn't include any details of the attack on the consulate in Tripoli, which is what killed him. The 94-word summary emerged from a daylong email debate between more than two dozen intelligence officials, in which they contested and whittled the available evidence into a bland summary with no reference to al-Qaeda, an assessment the administration now acknowledges was wide of the mark. The Times also takes a look at the State Department's response to the attack, and finds that it \"did little to mollify critics\"\u2014including John Kerry, who called it a \"cover-up\" in an interview last week.", "\u2013 An erupting volcano has created a new island in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Tonga. The volcano has been erupting for a month in the ocean about 40 miles northwest of the capital, Nuku'alofa. Last week it disrupted international air travel to the Pacific archipelago for several days. New Zealand volcanologist Nico Fournier said he traveled by boat to within about a mile of the new island on Saturday to take a closer look. He said it's made mainly of loose scoria and its dimensions are about 1.1 miles by 0.9 miles, and that it rises about 109 yards above the sea. \"It's quite an exciting site, you get to see the birth of an island,\" he tells the AP. \"Visually it was quite spectacular, but there was no big sound coming with it, no boom. It was a bit eerie.\" He said that once the volcano stops erupting, it will likely take the ocean no more than a few months to erode the island entirely. He said it would need to be made of lava or something more durable to survive. Fournier, who works for New Zealand agency GNS Science, said he was able to establish that the volcano was mainly belching steam into the atmosphere, and that the small amount of ash", "\u2013 The number of children in the US who rely on food stamps has spiked since the start of the Great Recession, according to a US Census Bureau survey released yesterday. In 2007, before the recession began, about 9 million children were living with married parents who received food stamps, or about one in eight, the New York Times reports. \"The rate of children living with married parents who receive food stamps has doubled since 2007,\" the Census Bureau says. The number of people using food stamps has almost doubled since the start of the recession, to nearly 48 million in 2013, but only dipped a little last year, to about 46 million people, the Times reports.

In 2012, Shaw said \"it was the black cloud of Christie Brinkley\u2019s hate\" that caused her marriage to Peter Cook to fall apart, when Cook had actually been cheating on Brinkley with his 18-year-old assistant. \"Christie was wrongly vilified as being an embittered ex-wife,\" Shaw continues. \"I now believe she had every right to do what she did by taking a public stand; she was only trying to protect her children and have the truth be told.

It's not clear what has ailed it. Maybe Spelacchio was unsettled by the trip; perhaps it was ill on departure. By way of explanation, tree historian Antimo Palumbo, a tree historian who was standing by Spelacchio's side on Friday morning, pointed at the concrete all over its roots. \"You see that?\" he told me. \"They decided to pour the concrete to keep it steady, but that killed it instead.\" There isn't enough time, money, or political will to replace the tree, and so Spelacchio the Mangy will stay in Piazza Venezia through the holidays, and for many locals it has already become a metaphor for what's wrong with the city, and the country. Traffic in Rome is chronically congested, public transport is inefficient, trash collection is slow, and sporadic.

Here's a look at some of the highlights, via the AP, the Washington Post, the New York Times, and the Los Angeles Times: On Roe v. Wade: \"The court has never ruled that Roe v. Wade is settled law,\" Kavanaugh said, per the Times. \"It has never ruled that a president has the power to decide a case in the midst of a presidential campaign.\" But he added that courts are \"the final word\" on such matters. Gay rights: Kavanaugh declined to say whether the Supreme Court's ruling legalizing same-sex marriage was correctly decided, the New York Times reports. He did, however, say that gay people \"cannot be treated as social outcasts or as inferior in dignity and worth.\" Mueller: \"I have no knowledge of or have knowledge of any improper contact\" between President Trump and Russia, Kavanaugh said when pressed by Sen. Kamala Harris of California. He did, however, say he has not been briefed on Robert Mueller's investigation. Abortion: \"I believe Roe v. Wade is settled law,\" Kavanaugh said when pressed by Sen.", "\u2013 The brouhaha over Family Guy's decision to air an image of the prophet Muhammad has turned into a real-life soap opera, according to the New York Daily News. The Daily News reports that Fox ordered 20 episodes of the show to be pulled after the network threatened to ban an upcoming episode over the image. According to the Hollywood Reporter, the decision to pull the episodes was made by Fox Animation, the show's parent company. The episode in question, titled \"The Battle for Muhammad,\" was supposed to air on Sept. 14. But Fox ordered the episodes to be pulled after it was discovered that they were being produced by Warner Bros., which produces Family Guy.

But the president's financial strength doesn't guarantee victory, notes the Los Angeles Times. Polls show that voters are more likely to vote for an unnamed Republican candidate than for Obama in 2012. Obama is still relying heavily on big donors, including former Goldman Sachs executive Jon Corzine and Dreamworks Animation chief executive Jeffrey Katzenberg, who have raised at least $500,000 for the president. At least 41 people have raised at least half a million dollars for the president, compared to 27 in Obama's first report. The president regularly brings in more than $1 million in a single evening of fundraising, as supporters donate the legal maximum of $35,800 to his campaign and the Democratic party for the chance to have dinner and take a picture with the president. At least 40% of all the money raised by the Obama campaign and the Democratic National Committee last quarter came from those giving in increments of $200 or less. \"They are still doing well with small donors,\" said a Brookings Institution director of governance studies.", "\u2013 A woman was killed and at least five others were injured Saturday when a 100-foot-tall eucalyptus tree uprooted and fell on a wedding party in a California park, the Los Angeles Times reports. According to the Whittier Daily News, the wedding party was taking pictures under the tree at Penn Park when it suddenly fell. \"It was supposed to be one of the most exciting days of their lives,\" the mayor of Whittier says. \"Instead, it turned into what it turned into.\" A 4-year-old girl was hospitalized in critical condition. The other five injured people suffered minor to moderate injuries and were taken to a hospital for treatment. A search dog was brought in to look for more victims who could still be trapped under the tree. \"Fortunately, there weren't more people injured by the tree collapse,\" a Los Angeles County Fire Department deputy chief says. \"It could have been a lot worse.\" The wedding party was taken to a senior center where mental health counselors were available to them, NBC Los Angeles reports. It's not clear what caused the tree to fall.

Officers began searching just before 2pm Wednesday for Jimmy Causey, an inmate at Lieber Correctional Institution, about 90 miles southeast of Columbia, according to Sommer Sharpe, spokeswoman for the Department of Corrections. No other details have been released, the AP reports. Causey, 46, has now escaped from two different prisons in a dozen years. He and another inmate, convicted murderer Johnny Brewer, escaped Broad River Correctional Institution in Columbia in 2005 by hiding in a trash truck. The pair eluded authorities for three days before being apprehended at a motel along busy Interstate 95, not far from the prison from which Causey escaped on Wednesday. A pizza delivery driver told the AP at the time she tipped off authorities when she recognized a customer as one of the two men being sought by authorities. Both men were returned to prison. Brewer was found two years later, hanging from a bed sheet in his cell. Grilled by state lawmakers about how the escape happened, then-prisons director Jon Ozmint blamed budget cutbacks that had forced his department to cut 800 security positions, leaving some areas like the trash compactor and loading dock unmonitored by officers. The director also said", "\u2013 Lois Lerner, the IRS official at the center of the agency's Tea Party mess, has been placed on administrative leave, reports the Hill. Lerner, who heads the IRS division that oversees tax-exempt groups, first revealed the extra scrutiny conservative groups received almost two weeks ago, when she asked a lawyer at an American Bar Association conference whether the IRS had targeted conservative groups. Lerner has been under fire from lawmakers from both parties for her role in the scandal, and on Wednesday, she invoked her Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination at a House Oversight hearing. She will still be paid while on leave, reports the Washington Post. New IRS chief Danny Werfel had asked her to resign, but she refused. \"Not only is she the person who was in charge of the group that wrongly targeted conservatives, she dishonestly testified that she didn\u2019t know about the targeting until 2012, when the inspector general found she knew as early as 2011,\" writes Matthew Yglesias at Slate. \"She\u2019s the person who told a conference call of reporters, 'I\u2019m not that good at math,' even though she\u2019s a manager in an agency that\u2019s at bottom all about math.\"", "\u2013 Bob Woodward's new book, The Choice, takes a behind-the-scenes look at the Clintons, including the first lady's imaginary conversations with dead people. In the Chicago Sun-Times, Woodward writes that Hillary Clinton \"virtually moved into the White House\" to help write her book, It Takes a Village and Other Lessons Children Teach Us, and had imaginary chats with dead people including Eleanor Roosevelt, Mahatma Gandhi, and Jean Houston, co-director of the Foundation for Mind Research. \"Most people in the White House did not know about Hillary's sessions with Houston,\" Woodward writes. \"To some of the few who did, the meetings could trigger politically damaging comparisons to Nancy Reagan's use of astrology.\" Clinton's spokeswoman, Lisa Caputo, says the first lady's interest in Houston is no secret, CNN reports.

The unnamed man, whose identity has not been released, is recovering well and is expected to regain both urinary and sexual function, reports USA Today. The 14-hour procedure, which involved a large skin graft covering part of the sergeant's abdomen, was the most extensive yet, involving more tissue than has been previously transplanted. In addition to a large skin graft covering part of the sergeant's abdomen, penis and scrotum, surgeons connected three arteries, four veins, and two nerves to provide blood flow and sensation to the donated tissue. The patient did not receive testicles from his donor to avoid the ethical issues that might ensue if he later had children, says Damon Cooney, another transplant team member. The donor was not identified, nor was his cause of death, but in a statement, his family praised the sergeant's service to his country and noted the donor family includes a number of veterans. \"We are so thankful to say that our loved one would be proud and honored to know he provided such a special gift to you,\" said", "\u2013 Melquan Kwame Robinson's parents are \"upset over the fact of how could this happen,\" a family friend tells the Augusta Chronicle.

Three other people were injured in the incident, including a child who tried to pull Melquan from the fence. \"The friends, the way they responded, what motivates a young boy that young to jump into action and help their friend out,\" the friend tells the Chronicle. \"Those are the two young boys that are in the hospital right now because they were trying to help out a friend.\" Melquan's parents are also grieving the loss of their firstborn and one of three children, the family friend says. \"You can play the what ifs in many different scenarios and it will never get any better,\" he says. \"The fact that this situation happened with so many kids out here, it's heartbreaking.\" Melquan was a member of the Trinity Elite Titans football team, which posted a statement on Facebook: \"Good morning everyone, this is a sad moment for our Trinity Elite Titans family......we are still in disbelief.

If you're like most of us, you've probably suffered some sort of back injury while doing so, and now a new study suggests you might want to think about getting a physiotherapist to come to your aid. The study, published in the journal Physical Review Letters, looked at the effects of exercise on the musculoskeletal system, including the back, neck, and shoulder, and found that those who used a physiotherapist's advice to rehabilitate their backs after snow shoveling fared better than those who used a non- physiotherapist's advice, reports the Telegraph.

Now, after a major restoration at Jerusalem's Church of the Holy Sepulchre last year, scientists say they've dated the site to the AD 325 period when the Romans were said to have discovered it, National Geographic reports. \"Scientists and archaeologists are very excited about this because, what it does is, it corroborates our historical accounts,\" says National Geographic archaeology writer Kristin Romey, who was on the site during the nine-month restoration project. \"There is so much information in the data that was collected by the restorers during the conservation project,\" says an archaeologist. \"There are many, many stories still to be told.\" The tomb, known as the Holy Edicule, was opened for the first time in centuries in October 2016.

Researchers asked 71 car crash victims waiting for treatment at one hospital to briefly recall a traumatic incident, then gave half of them a written activity to do while the other half played the game, reports the New York Times. They found that those who played the game while waiting for treatment were less likely to be diagnosed with PTSD than those who played the game while they were still in the hospital. The study, published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, didn't examine why the Tetris-playing group was less likely to have PTSD than the other group, but lead researcher Dr. Supat Thammasitboon of the University of Sydney says it's possible the game played while they were in the hospital may have helped them deal with the stress of being in a car accident. \"It's possible that the stress of being in a car accident may have helped them to deal with the PTSD that they were dealing with at the time,\" he says. \"It's also possible that playing Tetris while in the hospital may have helped them to deal with the PTSD that they were not dealing with at the time.\" (A new study suggests that", "\u2013 A former associate of Paul Manafort has become the second person to plead guilty in Robert Mueller's investigation.

Park's office has confirmed that it bought about 360 erectile dysfunction pills and a generic version of the drug in December to treat altitude sickness on official trips to Ethiopia, Uganda, and Kenya, where capitals are thousands of feet above sea level, the Guardian reports. South Korean doctors sometimes prescribe Viagra-style drugs to climbers because they are believed to be effective in preventing altitude sickness. The revelation comes as Park grapples with a massive political scandal. The president is now bracing for an impeachment push by opposition parties and some members of her own Saenuri party amid allegations that she let a secretive confidante manipulate government affairs and amass an illicit fortune, a scandal critics say undermines the country's democracy.

That's because Thursday is the deadline for retailers to update their payment terminals to accept the new \"chip-enabled\" cards, which MasterCard and Visa are rolling out in the US later this year, the Wall Street Journal reports. The change, which Visa and MasterCard say will make the US the most secure country in the world for credit and debit cards, is meant to reduce fraud, which has more than doubled in the US over the past 15 years. But while the new cards are more secure than their magnetic-strip counterparts, they're also more expensive to use, taking between five and 10 seconds to process compared to three to five seconds with the magnetic-strip system, Tech Times reports.

Microbrewers already flavor their beers with coffee, and scientists collected coffee grounds from a Portuguese roasting company and heated the powder in water for 45 minutes, separated out the liquid, and added sugar. Next, they mixed in yeast cells, let the concoction ferment, and concentrated the sample to get a higher alcohol content, reports Science. To evaluate the product, eight trained taste testers were brought in and rated the intensity of different smells and flavors in the alcohol. The judges described the drink as smelling like coffee and tasting bitter and pungent. Researchers noted that the taste could be improved with age and concluded that the quality was good enough for consumption.

The Vatican secretary of state said in a condolence message on Saturday that the pontiff \"prays that this pointless slaughter will awaken consciences, lead to a change of heart, and inspire all parties to lay down their arms and take up the path of dialogue,\" the AP reports. Officials and witnesses in Yemen said gunmen on Friday stormed a retirement home run by a charity established by Mother Teresa, moving room to room handcuffing the victims before shooting them in the head. The pope sent prayers for the dead and expressed his spiritual closeness to those affected by this \"this act of senseless and diabolical violence.\" The Vatican said two of the nuns killed were Rwandan, one was Indian, and one was from Kenya. The nuns were from the Missionaries of Charity congregation, which runs the home and was founded in Calcutta by Mother Teresa. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, though Yemeni officials have blamed so-called Islamic State.

Delia Garcia-Bratcher, 30, came to an elementary school around lunchtime Friday and asked her son, who also attends the school, to point out her daughter's alleged tormentor, the Sonoma County Sheriff's office said in a statement, per the AP. The mother grabbed the boy by the throat in front of a number of children, the statement said. No adult saw the confrontation, and Garcia-Bratcher apparently had not checked in with the school office before coming on campus. The young witnesses later told a deputy the mother threatened the boy about bullying her daughter. The staff at Olivet Charter Elementary School took photos of red marks on the boy's neck as soon as they learned about the alleged assault, authorities said. Garcia-Bratcher was arrested on a charge of felony child abuse. She was released from jail after posting a $30,000 bail. A telephone number for a Delia Bratcher was disconnected. But on a Facebook page that said it belonged to Bratcher, she posted that she was hurt by the accusation and asserted that \"the truth will be told.\" Lt.

Researchers in Kenya played recordings of voices\u2014some local Maasai men, some young Kamba men, female Maasai speakers, and others\u2014to elephants, and found that the elephants reacted in the same way. The Maasai men said the same phrase, \"Look, look over there, a group of elephants is coming,\" and the elephants tended to gather together, start smelling, and move cautiously away when they heard the men. But when they heard the young Kamba men, females, or adult male Maasai voices, they didn't react in the same way. \"Their response to hearing Maasai men talking was to be alert, to move away, but not to run away in total fear,\" a conservation biologist not involved in the study tells AFP. \"It is suggesting that elephants are capable of thinking, (of) recognizing that if Maasai men are talking, they are not likely to be hunting because if they were hunting, they would be quiet.\" The elephants also acted the same way when recordings of lions were played, but they bunched together so that juveniles were in the center, and moved toward the sounds as if to scare the lion away.", "\u2013 Russell Crowe walked out on a BBC interview yesterday after an interviewer questioned his accent in Robin Hood.

Holcomb is one of eight soldiers charged in the case. Chen killed himself a week after the assault, which involved being dragged across rocks by Holcomb for ignoring orders. Holcomb's lawyers say Chen killed himself because his immigrant parents disowned him for joining the Army instead of going to college. Chen's platoon also faced hazing before his death, including kicking him and pelting him with rocks, but none of the soldiers have been charged.", "\u2013 Facebook-owned Instagram has backed down from plans to sell users' photos and give advertisers access to their data after a public outcry.

Assemblyman John Wisniewski, the bill's sponsor, says the legislation is aimed at discouraging distracted driving and that he cannot imagine that a police officer would pull anyone over for drinking coffee. Current law already prohibits texting or talking without a hands-free device. The new legislation is broader and would bar \"any activity unrelated to the actual operation of a motor vehicle in a manner that interferes with the safe operation of the vehicle.\" Wisniewski says he sponsored the bill seven months ago, but he has yet to bring it up for a vote in a committee he leads. It also never came up for a vote in the two previous legislative sessions in which he introduced similar bills. The outcry against the bill has been so strong that his inbox has filled up even more than when he proposed a 25-cent-per-gallon increase in the gas tax.

A study of 258,000 patients diagnosed with colon and rectal cancers between 1998 and 2011 found that about 15% of them were younger than 50, reports Reuters. That means that by 2030, nearly one in four rectal tumors and more than one in 10 colon cancers will be diagnosed in people under 50. \"Colorectal cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly; this study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colorectal cancers are occurring in young people,\" Hendren tells the New York Times. The researchers say the results suggest that it's time for the medical community to start paying more attention to the younger set of patients, who are more likely to be diagnosed with tumors that have spread to other organs or that have metastasized, meaning the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. Younger patients with tumors that have spread to the lymph nodes were 30% more likely to be diagnosed with that cancer, and 50% more likely to have cancer", "\u2013 \"It would sound like someone drove into your house, but as far as we know it didn't cause any damage,\" Justin Schultz, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Sullivan, Wis., tells the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

The situation at the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant is now rated at level 5, the same as the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, but officials say it is at least as bad as Three Mile Island. In another development, engineers attached a power cable to the outside of the plant today in a race to prevent deadly radiation from an accident now rated at least as bad as America's Three Mile Island incident in 1979. Further cabling inside was under way before an attempt to restart water pumps needed to cool overheated nuclear fuel rods.

Scientists have tried to get stem cells from cloned human embryos for about a decade, but they've failed generally because the embryos stopped developing before producing the cells. In 2004, a South Korean scientist claimed to have gotten stem cells from cloned human embryos, but that turned out to be a fraud.

Dr. George Daley, a stem cell expert at Children's Hospital Boston who didn't participate in the work, called the new results \"one landmark step in a very long journey\" toward creating DNA-matched transplant tissue. Now, Daley says, scientists must compare the embryo-cloning approach with another technology that reprograms blood or skin cells directly into substitutes for embryonic stem cells.
